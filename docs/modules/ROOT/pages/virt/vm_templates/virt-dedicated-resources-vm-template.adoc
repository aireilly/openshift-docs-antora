Virtual machines can have resources of a node, such as CPU,
dedicated to them to improve performance.

include::ROOT:partial$virt-about-dedicated-resources.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

== Prerequisites

* The
xref:scalability_and_performance/using-cpu-manager.adoc[CPU Manager]  must
be configured on the node. Verify that the node has the `cpumanager` = `true`
label before scheduling virtual machine workloads.
