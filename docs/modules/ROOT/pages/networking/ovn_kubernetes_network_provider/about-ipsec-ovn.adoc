toc::[]

With IPsec enabled, all network traffic between nodes on the OVN-Kubernetes Container Network Interface (CNI) cluster network travels through an encrypted tunnel.

IPsec is disabled by default.

[NOTE]
====
IPsec encryption can be enabled only during cluster installation and cannot be disabled after it is enabled.
For installation documentation, refer to xref:installing/installing-preparing.adoc#installing-preparing[Selecting a cluster installation method and preparing it for users].
