As a cluster administrator, installing the {pipelines-title} Operator creates variants of each default cluster task known as _versioned cluster tasks_ (VCT) and _non-versioned cluster tasks_ (NVCT). For example, installing the {pipelines-title} Operator v1.7 creates a `buildah-1-7-0` VCT and a `buildah` NVCT. 

Both NVCT and VCT have the same metadata, behavior, and specifications, including `params`, `workspaces`, and `steps`. However, they behave differently when you disable them or upgrade the Operator.
