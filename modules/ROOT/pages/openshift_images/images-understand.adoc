Containers, images, and image streams are important concepts to understand when you set out to create and manage containerized software. An image holds a set of software that is ready to run, while a container is a running instance of a container image. An image stream provides a way of storing different versions of the same basic image. Those different versions are represented by different tags on the same image name.
