The {product-title} 4 installation program provides only a low number of configuration options before installation. Configuring most {product-title} framework components, including the cluster monitoring stack, happens post-installation.

This section explains what configuration is supported, shows how to configure the monitoring stack, and demonstrates several common configuration scenarios.

== Prerequisites

* The monitoring stack imposes additional resource requirements. Consult the computing resources recommendations in xref:scalability_and_performance/scaling-cluster-monitoring-operator.adoc#scaling-cluster-monitoring-operator[Scaling the Cluster Monitoring Operator] and verify that you have sufficient resources.

== Preparing to configure the monitoring stack

You can configure the monitoring stack by creating and updating monitoring config maps.

// Configuring persistent storage
[id="configuring-persistent-storage"]
== Configuring persistent storage

Running cluster monitoring with persistent storage means that your metrics are stored to a persistent volume (PV) and can survive a pod being restarted or recreated. This is ideal if you require your metrics or alerting data to be guarded from data loss. For production environments, it is highly recommended to configure persistent storage. Because of the high IO demands, it is advantageous to use local storage.

[NOTE]
====
See xref:scalability_and_performance/optimizing-storage.adoc#recommended-configurable-storage-technology_persistent-storage[Recommended configurable storage technology].
====

[id="persistent-storage-prerequisites"]
=== Persistent storage prerequisites

* Dedicate sufficient local persistent storage to ensure that the disk does not become full. How much storage you need depends on the number of pods. For information on system requirements for persistent storage, see xref:scalability_and_performance/scaling-cluster-monitoring-operator.adoc#prometheus-database-storage-requirements_cluster-monitoring-operator[Prometheus database storage requirements].

* Verify that you have a persistent volume (PV) ready to be claimed by the persistent volume claim (PVC), one PV for each replica. Because Prometheus and Alertmanager both have two replicas, you need four PVs to support the entire monitoring stack. The PVs are available from the Local Storage Operator, but not if you have enabled dynamically provisioned storage.

* Use `Filesystem` as the storage type value for the `volumeMode` parameter when you configure the persistent volume.

* xref:storage/persistent_storage/persistent-storage-local.adoc#persistent-storage-using-local-volume[Configure local persistent storage.]

[NOTE]
====
If you use a local volume for persistent storage, do not use a raw block volume, which is described with `volumeMode: Block` in the `LocalVolume` object. Prometheus cannot use raw block volumes.
